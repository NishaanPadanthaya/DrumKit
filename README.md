# DrumKit
This is a basic web application built using HTML , CSS  and JavaScript.
In this there are six drum sounds and by clicking on the drum images that particular sound is generated.
The sounds can be generated even by pressing the particular keys of the keyboard as the drum images are labelled with letters .
By this you can create different drum sounds using javascripts's Event Handling.
